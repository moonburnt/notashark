*100% not a shark bot clone, definely didnt take few hours to write*

**Description:**

Well, its discord bot for King Arthur's Gold, written in python and configurable with environment variables (or just attached .sh file). Thus far it only lists (and automatically updates each 30 seconds) active servers in channel you will tell it to use for this case, also greets newcomers. But I may add some stuff in future (dont wanna make it complicated tho)

**Dependencies:**

- python 3.8 (may work on previous versions, that just the one that runs on my machine rn)
- python-requests
- [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py)
- [pykagapi](https://github.com/moonburnt/pykagapi)

**Usage:**

- Open the bootin_up.sh
- Edit its content accordingly (set up DISCORD_KEY, STATISTICS_CHANNEL_ID and LOG_CHANNEL_ID)
- Run `./bootin_up.sh`
