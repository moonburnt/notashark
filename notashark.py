### Dead-simple discord bot for King Arthur's Gold

### Patch Notes:
## Fixed some typos
## Added basic footer to statistics embed, featuring info about amount of time between updates
## Added few safety checks here and there
## Now keeping server's country in memory, which should drammatically reduce the amount of requests to geojs.io
################
### TODO:
## for each server, make another embed's field (up to 25), instead of keeping everything inside description (should increase amount of info possible to show - from 2048 symbols per description to 6k per whole embed)
## add some indicators for spectators and password-protected servers
